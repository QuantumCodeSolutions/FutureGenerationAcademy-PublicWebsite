We are very flexible in our approach as we recognise that each child is different. We will ensure your child is settled in to ensure they feel comfortable and safe, plus ensuring parents are fully at ease.</p><p>Prior to starting, we have a settling in procedure. On the first day we ask that the parent stay with the child for a 2-hour period either 10am to 12pm or 2pm to 4pm. This allows the child’s relationship with the carers and other children in the room to develop and gives us an opportunity to learn your child’s routine and preferences.</p></div></section></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><a class="logo" href="https://quantumcodesolutions.github.io/FutureGenerationAcademy-PublicWebsite/">Future Generation Academy</a><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Future Generation Academy - Kuwait</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://quantumcodesolutions.github.io/FutureGenerationAcademy-PublicWebsite/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://quantumcodesolutions.github.io/FutureGenerationAcademy-PublicWebsite/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8321f1cbd9dc599d29b78a6d974c1825"></script></body></html>
