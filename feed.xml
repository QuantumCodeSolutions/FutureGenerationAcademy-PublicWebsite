<p>Settling in</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="av_textblock_section ">
<div class="avia_textblock  ">
<p>When your child starts at Clayhall Nursery and Pre-School, the settling in period is handled with the most loving care for your child and respect for their parents wishes. We are very flexible in our approach as we recognise that each child is different. We will ensure your child is settled in to ensure they feel comfortable and safe, plus ensuring parents are fully at ease.</p>
<p>Prior to starting, we have a settling in procedure. On the first day we ask that the parent stay with the child for a 2-hour period either 10am to 12pm or 2pm to 4pm. This allows the child’s relationship with the carers and other children in the room to develop and gives us an opportunity to learn your child’s routine and preferences.</p>

<p>Here at Clayhall Nursery we live by our motto <em>“….preparing for life…” </em>The fast-paced modern world, the prevalence of social media and competition for schools and jobs, means there are new challenges and pressures faced by us all in this time, especially our children. Our mission is to provide an additional foundation away from the home, where your child will be brimming with self-confidence and also have assurance in their own abilities. We do this through the skills of our dedicated experienced team, where we follow the early years foundation stage curriculum, but also add our own innovative ways to learn.</p>
